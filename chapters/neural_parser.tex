\chapter{Neural dependency parser}

\section{Overview of the network architecture}
The network architecture consists of three main parts: reader, tagger and parser
(see Figure \ref{fig:architecture}). The reader subnetwork is evaluated on
each individual word in a sentence, and using convolutions on their orthographic
representation produces words embeddings. Next, the tagger subnetwork implemented
as bidirectional RNN equips each word with a context of whole sentence. Finally
parser part computes dependency tree parent for each word using attention mechanism
\cite{vinyals_pointer_2015} after which network computes appropriate dependency label.
In the following paragraphs we will describe all parts in detail.
